So, this is a python script that will show you the mathematical pi and solve math problems, WARNING: THIS SCRIPT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING SYMBOLS: × and ÷




I know it is frustrating, but I will try to do my best to make it solve the × and ÷ problems in the FUTURE.





Bye Bye and have fun.
